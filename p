1. Ocean (Hero Scene)

Scene Description:

Mouse-wave interactive hero with bioluminescent water surface.

Audio-reactive subtle waves (bioluminescence glows with audio amplitude).

Primary CTA floats on liquid surface.

mousemove / touch drag generates radial displacement in water shader. Mobile: tilt/gyro fallback or simplified parallax.



Elements:

Floating skill icons randomly placed on each load; glow pulses asynchronously, shaking softly.

Education cards:

3D interactive, tilting on hover, light reacts to mouse.

Glow & subtle shadow layers for depth.


Subtle caustics and reflections on water for realism.


Interactions:

Mouse movement affects wave & icon motion.

Audio waveform subtly affects glow intensity.

Hover on education card triggers 3D tilt + glow highlight.

2. Transition (Ocean → Space)

Scene Description:

Smooth liquid-to-nebula morph shader-driven transition.

Particle trails lead eye from ocean into space.


Details:

Precomputed noise textures for smooth, GPU-friendly morph.

Slight user-controlled scroll to influence morph speed.


Interactions:

Floating particles move subtly during transition.

Optional glow pulses to highlight flow direction.


once Transition happend Ocean transition section gone totally. those section will fill up with starfield with multiple size star some are glowing. some are moving. frequently lighting effect on that area. Project section will take this place (their place + thransition place) Planets will moveing here randomly.

3. Space (Projects)

Scene Description:

Projects displayed as interactive planets in a 3D skybox.

Background: layered stars with subtle twinkles and shooting stars.


Elements:

Filter chips: React / Laravel / Vue, 3D interactive, floating slightly.

Planet hover: soft halo/glow, click: zoom + rotate animation.

Project card after click:

3D model viewer / gallery / case study.

Lazy-load 3D models for GPU performance.



Interactions:

Hover on planet triggers halo glow.

Filter chip selection animates planets moving / reorganizing.

Smooth zoom-in transition for project card.

4. 3D Blog

Scene Description:

Floating cards in low-gravity plane.

responsive seeded posts with glow pulsing randomly. on some device 3 cards, some device 4, some habe 5, some have 6. cards layout show but if post comeing delay then a blackhole type loader will show. after post load then post showing. for every blog post card.

Starfield: layered with small/medium/big stars glowing at random.


Elements:

Blog card details: upvote, downvote, read count, comments count.

“Read full” opens full space-zone blog grid.

Cards glow in random colors.

Hover increases glow.

user can commnet and reply to a particular commnet. nested reply system.



Interactions:

“See All Blog” button removes current elements smoothly, reveals full blog grid.

Cards fly from current positions to grid positions.

Background stars slowly twinkle; some shooting stars randomly appear.

Glow pulsing asynchronous for each card.

5. Contact Scene

Scene Description:

Message Orbit Composer: floating messages orbit around user’s cursor area.

Scene visually reacts to user interaction.


Interactions:

Submit triggers “Sending Signal” hold button: press & hold 7s to send.

While holding:

Circular progress indicator or glow around button.

Scene shake subtly, lighting flash from bottom → top randomly , random multiple color.


Orbiting messages move slightly with random deviations for realism.

6. Micro-Interactions & Audio

Subtle hover/click sounds for icons, planets, blog cards, buttons.

Mouse movement affects water wave, glow intensity, and floating elements.

Particle trails, star twinkle, and glow animations should feel alive but GPU-friendly.



---

7. Accessibility & Performance Notes

Keyboard navigation + ARIA labels for all interactive elements.

Reduced motion mode for users sensitive to parallax/animations.

GPU optimization tips:

Use GPU instancing for stars/icons.

Use LOD models for 3D projects.

Lazy-load heavy 3D assets and shaders.

audio on off button on top right corner.


8. Lighting, Glow & Mood

Dynamic lighting across scenes (especially space) for cinematic feel.

Slight variation in brightness over time to simulate day/night effect in space.

Glow intensities pulsing asynchronously for realism.



Random glow colors: deterministic by id is less jarring across sessions.

3D heavy on mobile: provide a low-power 2D fallback to save battery and avoid dropped frames.
